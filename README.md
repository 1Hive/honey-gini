## Honey Gini

A small script that calculates the [Gini coefficient][gini] of Honey.

### Usage

Some addresses are blacklisted (i.e. left out of the calculation), for example the Common Pool and major pairs on Honeyswap. To adjust this, along with the minimum amount of Honey a holder must have to be considered in the calculation, edit `bin.js`.

Run `node bin.js`.
